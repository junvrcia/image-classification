# Image Classification – TensorFlow Lite 

This project is a Java-based image classification application built using TensorFlow Lite.  
It demonstrates how a lightweight machine learning model can be integrated into a Java application to detect and classify everyday objects from images.

## Current Capabilities
The model is currently trained to detect the following object categories:
- Glasses
- Canned drink

Additional object classes and dataset expansion are planned for future improvements.

## Project Highlights
- Uses TensorFlow Lite for efficient on-device inference
- Implements image preprocessing and classification logic in Java
- Demonstrates end-to-end ML workflow: model integration, inference, and result handling

## Tech Stack
- Java
- TensorFlow Lite
- Image preprocessing utilities
- Git & GitHub

## How It Works
1. An input image is provided to the application
2. The image is preprocessed to match the model’s expected input format
3. TensorFlow Lite performs inference on the image
4. The predicted class label is returned based on the highest confidence score

## Project Status
This is an educational and exploratory project developed to gain hands-on experience with image classification and TensorFlow Lite integration in Java.  
The model currently supports a limited number of classes and can be extended with additional training data.

## Notes
The repository may contain experimental code and configurations as part of the learning process.  
Improvements such as additional object categories, model optimization, and UI enhancements can be added in future iterations.
